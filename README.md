### Notes
Simple math worksheet generator. To try it out: [MathSheetGenerator](https://lsanchez17.github.io/mathSheetGenerator/)

- To keep a local copy:
  - clone the repo
  - npm install
  - npm start

### Notes
- Roughly 70 problems will fit on a sheet when printed, anything more will likely go to a second sheet of paper
- Subtraction currently is not guaranteed to not include negative numbers (WIP)
- Division is not guaranteed to have whole numbers (WIP)
- Math sheet may repeat previous question in problem set (WIP)

## Customizable
 - Choose the number of problems
 - Choose the operator to use
 - Choose the difficulty tier
 - Choose to allow/disallow repeatable problems (WIP)

 ## RoadMap
 - Option for non-negative Subtraction
 - Option for division problems to have whole number quotients/no remainders
 - Difficulty reworks
 - Improvements to repeatable problems option logic
 - Algebra

 ## Distant RoadMap
 - Algebra II
 - Geometry proofs
 - Calculus
 - Matrices
